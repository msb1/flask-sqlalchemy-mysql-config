<ol>
 <li>Flask based REST microservice app to provide user with capability to setup configuration files for equipment</li>
<li>Bootstrap is used with editable datatables and modals to provide easy manipulation of manufacturing equipment configuration</li>
<li>Flask WTF is used for forms and Flask (SQL) Alchemy is used with MySQL to store configuration (A separate app is included to directly generate MySQL tables with data - this works directly with the Python MySQL Connector and does not use SQLAlchemy.)</li>

<li>The config file is generated by using SQLAlchemy filters to find parameters from subtables.</li>
